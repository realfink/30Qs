there is a prolem with the time zone and the connection with the database (warning only should be okey).

connecthion established using a driver referenced in referenced libraries (http://www.java2s.com/example/jar/m/download-mysqlconnectorjava8011jar-file.html).

need to write a file describing how the code works. 

farther commenting on the code needed including explentions of the diferent methods, and mentioning that the value of the id in the code startes from 0, and not from 1 as in the database.

ask eli winberg to revue the code in order to be able to get more help.
